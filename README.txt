-- SUMMARY --

Module to integrate the E-mail Marketing Framework (EMF) and Webform modules.

EMF webform provides a new Webform component which allows the creator to select a set of mailing lists exposed through EMF and link them to an email field. If the user selects one or more of the lists when submitting the form she also subscribes to the lists through EMF.
